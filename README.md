# [2025 Fall] COMPSCI 403. Introduction to Robotics
This repository includes code for CS 403 Final Project.

To run, pip install mujoco then run the Run_RapidReachingEnv.py file.

# Working robot arm:
## 1. Jacobian to find inverse kinematics (Mujoco has Jacobian function). Need to find error.
## 2. Calculate the torque for each angle
## 3. Animation for robot arm to move

# Bonus
## Finding the most optimal path / order of points (Use 1 reference)
## etc?
